# SEG-3103-Lab

This repository includes code to run a division function in 3 different languages. <br>
The languages are Python, Java, and Elixir <br>
The function takes 2 input numbers and returns the solution to num1/num2 <br>
All 3 of the functions should be run using wsl (if on windows), or bash (on linux) <br>
From there, for each language, you should enter the desired directory (newmath_py, newmath_java, or newmath_ex) <br>
Then run 'bin/compile', then 'bin/run', then 'bin/test' <br>
Each one has slightly different behaviour, but they all tell you what to do. <br>
